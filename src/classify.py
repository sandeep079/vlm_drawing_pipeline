# Lets verify output for all 4 input drawings:

# 001_redacted: This is a Sheet Metal 
# Model Output:
# {
#     "class": "Sheet",
#     "confidence": 1.0,
#     "evidence": "The drawing explicitly labels 'Abwicklung' (unfolded view) and 'Blechdicke: 3mm' (sheet thickness), which are definitive cues for sheet-metal fabrication. The component is shown as a flat pattern with holes and rounded corners, consistent with sheet metal, not a hollow tube."
# }
# Final Classification: Sheet

# 002_redacted: This is a Sheet Metal 
# Model Output:
# {
#     "class": "Sheet",
#     "confidence": 1.0,
#     "evidence": "The drawing's title block explicitly labels the component as 'PLATE'. Additionally, the material is specified as '3.3535 / AlMg3', which is a plate material, and the drawing shows a flat-pattern representation with dimensions consistent with a sheet-metal part."
# }
# Final Classification: Sheet

# 003_redacted: This is a Tube
# Model Output:
# {
#     "class": "Tube",
#     "confidence": 1.0,
#     "evidence": "The component is shown with a consistent hollow square cross-section in multiple views (images 2 and 3), and the title block explicitly labels it as 'SQUARE TUBE 80x80x10'. The long dimension (2790) in image 2 indicates a long profile relative to its cross-section, which is characteristic of a tube. The term 'TUBE' is directly visible in the drawing's title block."
# }
# Final Classification: Tube


# 004_redacted: This is a Sheet Metal
# Model Output:
# {
#     "class": "Sheet",
#     "confidence": 0.95,
#     "evidence": "The drawing includes the term 'ADAPTER PLATE' in the title block, which directly indicates a sheet-metal component. Additionally, the cross-section view shows a solid, flat profile with chamfered edges (5 X 45°) and a rounded corner (R5), which are typical of sheet metal fabrication rather than tube construction. The overall shape is consistent with a flat plate, not a hollow profile."
